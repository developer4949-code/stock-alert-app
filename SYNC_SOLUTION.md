# üîÑ Watchlist Sync Solution

## Problem Identified
When creating watchlists offline, they were stored in Room database but **not automatically syncing to the backend when the device came online**. The issue was:

1. ‚úÖ WorkManager was enqueuing sync work
2. ‚ùå No network connectivity monitoring
3. ‚ùå WorkManager wasn't retrying when network became available
4. ‚ùå No automatic sync trigger on network restoration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Network Connectivity Monitor (`NetworkConnectivityMonitor.kt`)
- **Monitors network state changes** using `ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback`
- **Automatically triggers sync** when network becomes available
- **Initial connectivity check** on app startup
- **Singleton pattern** for app-wide network monitoring

### 2. Enhanced SyncWorker (`SyncWorker.kt`)
- **Better error handling** with network vs non-network error distinction
- **Proper retry logic** for network failures
- **Detailed logging** for debugging sync issues
- **User-specific filtering** to only sync current user's watchlists

### 3. Improved WorkManager Configuration (`WatchlistRepository.kt`)
- **Network constraints** - only runs when network is available
- **Exponential backoff** for retry attempts
- **Unique work policy** to avoid duplicate sync requests
- **Initial delay** to prevent immediate execution

### 4. Manual Sync Button
- **Added to MainWatchlistScreen** for testing purposes
- **Allows manual sync trigger** when needed
- **Calls `repository.triggerManualSync()`**

## How It Works

### Offline Creation Flow:
1. User creates watchlist offline
2. Watchlist stored in Room with `isSynced = false`
3. WorkManager enqueues sync work with network constraints
4. Sync work waits for network availability

### Network Restoration Flow:
1. Device connects to network
2. `NetworkConnectivityMonitor` detects connectivity
3. Automatically triggers sync work
4. `SyncWorker` processes pending watchlists
5. API calls made to backend
6. Local watchlists marked as synced

### Manual Sync Flow:
1. User taps sync button
2. `WatchlistViewModel.triggerManualSync()` called
3. `WatchlistRepository.triggerManualSync()` enqueues work
4. Sync work executes immediately (if network available)

## Testing the Solution

### Test 1: Offline Creation
1. Turn off WiFi/mobile data
2. Create a new watchlist
3. Verify it appears in the UI (stored locally)
4. Check logs: `"Sync work enqueued with constraints and backoff"`

### Test 2: Network Restoration
1. Turn on WiFi/mobile data
2. Check logs: `"Network became available, triggering sync..."`
3. Check logs: `"Sync work enqueued successfully"`
4. Verify watchlist appears in backend

### Test 3: Manual Sync
1. Tap the sync button (üîÑ) in MainWatchlistScreen
2. Check logs: `"Manual sync triggered"`
3. Verify sync work executes

### Test 4: Error Handling
1. Create watchlist offline
2. Turn on network but make backend unavailable
3. Check logs for retry attempts
4. Verify exponential backoff behavior

## Log Messages to Monitor

```
NetworkMonitor: Network became available, triggering sync...
NetworkMonitor: Sync work enqueued successfully
WatchlistRepository: Sync work enqueued with constraints and backoff
SyncWorker: Found X pending watchlists to sync
SyncWorker: Successfully synced watchlist: [ID]
SyncWorker: Sync completed. Success: X, Failures: Y
```

## Configuration

### WorkManager Constraints:
- **Network Type**: `CONNECTED` (requires internet)
- **Backoff Policy**: `EXPONENTIAL` with 30-second base delay
- **Initial Delay**: 5 seconds
- **Unique Work**: `REPLACE` policy to avoid duplicates

### Network Monitor:
- **Capability**: `NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET`
- **Auto-trigger**: Yes, on network restoration
- **Initial Check**: Yes, on app startup

## Dependencies Added

- `NetworkConnectivityMonitor` - Network state monitoring
- Enhanced `SyncWorker` - Better error handling and retry logic
- Improved `WatchlistRepository` - Better WorkManager configuration
- Manual sync button in UI - For testing and manual sync

## Files Modified

1. `NetworkConnectivityMonitor.kt` - New file
2. `SyncWorker.kt` - Enhanced error handling
3. `WatchlistRepository.kt` - Better WorkManager config
4. `NetworkModule.kt` - Added NetworkConnectivityMonitor DI
5. `MainWatchlistScreen.kt` - Added manual sync button
6. `WatchlistViewModel.kt` - Added manual sync method
7. `AppApplication.kt` - Initialize network monitor

## Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ **Offline watchlists** are stored locally
- ‚úÖ **Network restoration** automatically triggers sync
- ‚úÖ **Failed syncs** are retried with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ **Manual sync** available via UI button
- ‚úÖ **User-specific filtering** prevents cross-user sync
- ‚úÖ **Detailed logging** for debugging and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Not Working:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify backend API is accessible
3. Check logs for error messages
4. Verify user is logged in
5. Check WorkManager constraints

### Multiple Sync Requests:
1. Verify unique work policy is working
2. Check for duplicate network callbacks
3. Monitor WorkManager queue

### Performance Issues:
1. Check sync frequency
2. Monitor WorkManager execution
3. Verify exponential backoff is working
